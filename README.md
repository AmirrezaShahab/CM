# Configuration Management Repository

This repository contains a collection of configuration management tools and scripts, focusing on automating and managing the infrastructure efficiently.

## Overview

One of the primary configuration management tools used in this repository is **Ansible**. Ansible is an open-source automation tool that helps to configure systems, deploy software, and manage configurations. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks, scale infrastructure efficiently, and maintain consistency across multiple systems.

## Features

- **Automation**: Automate the configuration and setup of systems and applications.
- **Declarative Syntax**: Use simple YAML syntax to describe your infrastructure as code.
- **No Agent Required**: Ansible works by connecting over SSH, so there's no need to install an agent on the managed nodes.
- **Idempotency**: Ansible ensures that tasks are only applied if they need to be, avoiding redundant operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with Ansible, follow these steps:

1. **Install Ansible**: 
   - For installation instructions, visit the official [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
